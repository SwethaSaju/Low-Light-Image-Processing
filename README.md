# 🌙 Low-Light Image Enhancement Using U-Net

A Streamlit web application that demonstrates low-light image enhancement.  
This project explores improving image visibility under poor lighting conditions using both classical and deep learning approaches.  
The current version runs entirely on Streamlit Cloud using lightweight Python libraries.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload and enhance low-light images interactively  
- Real-time adjustment of brightness, contrast, and gamma  
- Side-by-side comparison of original and enhanced images  
- Download option for the processed output  

---

## 🧠 Future Scope
- Integrate a trained **U-Net model** for deep learning–based enhancement  
- Extend to **real-time video enhancement**  
- Compare with advanced models like **Zero-DCE**, **EnlightenGAN**, and **SwinIR**
